🔌 OR Gate (Built Using NAND + NOT)

🧠 Overview

An OR gate outputs HIGH (`1`) if either input is HIGH — or if both are HIGH. This is called an inclusive OR Gate, It only returns LOW (`0`) when both inputs are LOW. In logical terms, this is `A OR B`.

We can implement this behavior using only NAND gates, by applying De Morgan's Theorem:

`A OR B = NOT(NOT A AND NOT B)`

This means we can:

- Invert A → A NAND A

- Invert B → B NAND B

- Feed both into a NAND gate: (NOT A) NAND (NOT B)

♻️ How It Works

1. Take input `A`, invert it using a NAND gate:` A NAND A`

2. Do the same for input `B`: `B NAND B`

3. Pass those two outputs into another NAND gate: `(NOT A) NAND (NOT B)`

The final result behaves exactly like `A OR B`.

This OR gate is constructed with three NAND gates — showing once again that NAND gates are truly universal.

🖋️ Real-World Analogy

Imagine I have two apples, one in each of my hands. If I hand you one — you have one or the other. If I hand you both — you still have "one or the other" (technically, both). This mirrors the behavior of an OR gate: it only cares that at least one input is present, hence why we call it inclusive OR gate.
